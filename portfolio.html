    <h1>Technical Portfolio</h1>
    <p>
      The most impactful experience I have had is at my internship at Hexagon’s Asset Lifecycle
      Intelligence Division’s Smart 3Dx team. Within this team, I worked on performance test
      automation and focused on detecting bottlenecks in large-scale deliverable updates by
      optimizing test systems that tracked 95% of total update time. This role significantly improved
      my collaboration skills because I worked within a professional development environment using
      Azure DevOps, Git, and Jenkins for version control and also the CI/CD pipelines. This experience
      truly changed my perspective and enlightened me on the importance of efficiency, scalability,
      and reliability in enterprise-grade software.

      The burning passion I have for robotics and real-time systems was sparked by my ongoing role
      as a Full-Stack Developer for the Texas A&M University Rover Challenge Team. I continue to lead
      both the front-end and also the back-end development of the graphical user interface. I also
      develop tools that help visualize live rover data streams such as the sensors and video feeds.
      This project was quite technically challenging as it required a multidisciplinary approach. I
      applied Python, PyQt5, OpenCV, and ROS to create user-friendly and reliable tools. I learned
      how to be resilient and how to work with a team by competing in this international competition.
