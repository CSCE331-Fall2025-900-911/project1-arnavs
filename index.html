      <legend>About Me</legend>
      <p>Howdy! I&apos;m Arnav Sharma</p>
      <hr>
      <p>My name is Arnav Sharma, a junior Computer Science student at Texas A&M University. I am doing a minor in statistics and I am passionate about designing intelligent systems. My journey in software engineering and artificial intelligence is characterized by previous internships, projects, and community service. I currently have a cumulative GPA of 3.8 and I have embraced a lot of technical rigor through my coursework and through the opportunities outside the classroom. I am continuing to find ways to apply the skills I have in meaningful ways. Both my academic and work experiences have created an awesome journey that reflects a balance between curiosity and discipline. From the beginning of my computer science studies in high school, I have been fascinated by the problem-solving aspect of computer science. Being able to break down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable pieces is what drives me to pursue a career in computer science. Furthermore, applying these skills into a practical setting also interested me. This inspired me to pursue projects that combine abstract computing ideas with real-world challenges, such as designing performance testing automation for enterprise software, building robotic control interfaces, and developing machine learning tools for agriculture. My favorite course I have taken in my undergraduate academic career has been data structures and algorithms. This class gave me a deeper understanding of how exactly data can be managed and manipulated. It helped me with endeavours outside of the classroom, such as leetcode and interview prep. Beyond my technical skills, I enjoy community service and serving others. I began volunteering in high school by teaching young students the basics of programming through coding drones. I have also done many food drives. Overall, this professional profile brings together many of my personal experiences, qualities, qualifications, and commitments to my lovely community.
